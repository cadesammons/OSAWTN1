        <h3>First Visit</h3>
        <p>Your initial appointment will consist of a consultation explaining your diagnosis and treatment options. Occasionally, surgery can be performed the same day as the consultation. However, a complex medical history or treatment plan will require an evaluation and a second appointment to provide treatment on another day.</p>
        <p>A preoporative consultaion and physical examniation is mandatory for patients undergoing IV anesthesia for surgery. Please have nothing to eat or drink eight hours prior to your surgery. You will also need an adult to drive you home.</p>
        <p>Please alert the office if you have a medical condition that may be of concern prior to surgery (i.e, diabetes, high blood presure, artificial heart valves and joints, rheumatic fever, etc.) or if you are currently taking any medication (i.e, heart medications, aspirin, anticoagulant therapy, etc.).</p>
        <h4>X-rays</h4>
        <p>If your dentist or physician has taken x-rays, you may request that they forward them to our office. If there is not enough time please pick them up and bring them to our office. If additional films are necessary, they can be taken at our facility.</p>
