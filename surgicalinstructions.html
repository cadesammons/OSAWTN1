        <h3>Before Anesthesia Sedation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You may not have anything to eat or drink for eight hours prior to the appointment.</li>
            <li>No Smoking at least 12 hours before surgery. Ideally, cut down or stop smoking as soon as possible prior to the day of surgery.</li>
            <li>A responsible adult must accompany the patient to the office, remain in the office during the procedure, and drive the patient home.</li>
            <li>The patient should not drive a vehicle or operate any machinery for 24 hours following the anesthesia experience.</li>
            <li>If you take routine oral medication, please check with Dr. Sammons prior to your surgical date for instructions.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>After Wisdom Tooth Removal</h3>
        <p>The removal of impacted teeth is a serious surgical procedure. Post-operative care is very important. Unnecessary pain and the complications of infection and swelling can be minimized if the instructions are followed carefully.</p>
        <h4>Immediately Following Surgery</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The gauze pads should be replaced 20-30 minutes until bleeding slows down. The gauze pads should be placed directly on each surgical site and firm pressure should be applied. More than one gauze pad may need to be used.</li>
            <li>NO SMOKING for 5 days after a surgical procedure. This would be a good time to QUIT smoking.</li>
            <li>Take the prescribed pain medications as soon as you begin to feel discomfort. This will usually coincide with the local anesthetic becoming diminished.</li>
            <li>Restrict your activities the day of surgery and resume normal activity when you feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>Place ice packs to the sides of your face where surgery was performed.</li>
